<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Alejandro Colomar has grown using Linux.  He has used computers since he
can remember, and he always had some Linux distro in some of the
computers.  He has tried many of them, his favourite one being Debian.
</p>

<p>
He learnt to program in C because he needed to solve some problems, and
computers do that fast if you teach them how to.  To learn to program,
he had to search in the internet, and ask in special sites about what he
couldn't find.  That was hard, but it was probably the best way to
learn.  To help people like him, he now collaborates in such sites
answering questions and reviewing code.
</p>

<p>
Later, at university, he polished his skills, learning about embedded
systems, robots, and more.  He could use his programming skills for some
interesting projects, such as solving statistics problems, analyzing
images for computer vision programs (for which he had to also learn C++
and python), communicate server and client programs to control remote
hardware such as robotic arms, etc.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, he continued developing personal projects for fun,
such as a mine-sweeper clone for the command line.  He used that project
to try features in his code such as cross-platform compilation (the game
could be compiled for both Linux and Windows), also tried GTK+ graphics,
helped him develop a consistent coding style similar to the Linux Kernel
one, which inspired him.
</p>

<p>
All his software is open-software, with the hope that it may be helpful
to others, as he also has taken advantage of open-source code developed
by others.  He uses git for version control, in which he has also become
an expert.
</p>

<p>
After so many years of programming, he has developed a C & C++ library
in which he has curated useful functions which he uses in his programs.
This library is one of the keys that make him be a very efficient
programmer, not having to repeat the same code in every new project he
works in.  This library focuses on safety and simplicity, and the
interface is designed so that it is as intuitive as possible, and it is
as difficult as possible to write buggy code.
</p>

<p>
Alejandro Colomar also contributes to other open-source projects, either
through mailing lists or github and other git servers, with bug reports,
and also sending patches to fix those he knows how to solve, and also to
add new features to software.  His most notable contributions have been
to the Linux man-pages project, where he has contributed with many
patches documenting features of the Linux Kernel and the GNU C library,
and fixing and improving existing documentation.
</p>

<p>
More recently, he learnt about high availability servers using Docker,
Kubernetes, and other software, and he deployed the server that serves
this web site in a way that it can be deployed anywhere easily and
doesn't fall because of hardware or software failures.
</p>

<p>
Alejandro Colomar is an expert in C, Git and Shell, and has enough
knowledge in C++ and Python to work in complex projects.  He also
knows a few other programming and scripting languages which he
occasionally uses for specific needs.
</p>

<p>
He has worked in projects where he has been asked to solve a problem
however starting from scratch, and also in some other projects where he
had to work in an already existing team improving and helping desing new
features, and also simplifying the code base and coordinating the other
programmers to follow best practices.
</p>

<p>
Alejandro Colomar loves nature, and when he is not in front of a
computer he usually is wherever there are (tall) trees he can climb.  He
was in the Military for some years, where he enjoyed being most of the
time in the mountains.  He is also an Outdoor Activities Instructor, and
has coached a children baseball team for two years.
</p>
